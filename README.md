## Running the System

1. After downloading the dependencies, navigate to the `server` folder using the terminal or command prompt. Then, run `nodemon app.js` command to start the web server:

2. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` to access the website.

## Additional Information

- The server is running on port 3000, if you need to change the port you can edit it in the `app.js` file.

We hope you enjoy using our web project!
